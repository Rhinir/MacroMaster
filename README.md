# MacroMaster

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to the MacroMaster platform, detailing its architecture, the algorithms used for analysis, and the design of the user interface. MacroMaster is designed to automate the documentation, transformation, and optimization of VBA macros, providing users with modernized and optimized code equivalents.

## Overview of MacroMaster

MacroMaster is a web-based application built using Python and Flask. It leverages Cohere's Large Language Model (LLM) to perform various tasks on VBA macro code, such as documentation, functional logic extraction, flowchart visualization, modernization, and optimization. The platform aims to make the process of working with VBA macros easier and more efficient for both technical and non-technical users.
