Title: Sort Data in Multiple Columns

Functional Logic:
This VBA macro sorts the data in the active spreadsheet based on multiple columns. It arranges the information in Column A in ascending order, then Column B, and so on. The range of cells from A1 to C13 is specified as the area to be sorted. The macro ensures that the header row is included in the sorting process.
